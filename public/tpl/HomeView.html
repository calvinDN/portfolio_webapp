        <strong>Hello!</strong>
        This is a simple webapp I have built to improve my understanding of web development. It is basically a portfolio website where you can add and remove your projects, each project has associated resources. Resources are just a list of things you used in the creation of the project so you can give credit and show your proficiencies.
